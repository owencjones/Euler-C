# Project Euler Problems in C
I'm looking at C again after about 15 years, so I figured trying the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems would be a good start for getting back into the language.
I don't have any particular reason for getting back into C, so I don't know how frequently I'll actually look at these, but the first milestone is to have the first 100 done.

## Running the programs
You can run any of these, if you really want to, using `gcc` like so, on a Posix or posix-esque system.
```
$ gcc FILENAME -o OUTPUTBINARYFILENAME
```
None of them are dependant on non-standard libraries, or even much more than `stdio`, `stdlib`, and maybe `string`, so you shouldn't have any problems.

If you encounter any issue, please don't hesitate to contact [someone else](https://stackoverflow.com) for help ;)
